## About this project
This project was developed for the Object Oriented Programming class, back in 2018. We were supposed to create a terminal that emulates basic terminal commands
like copying files, creating folders, deleting files, listing folders, move files... All of these with the option of using Windows syntax and Unix-like syntax.

## Available commands
Here's an overview of the commands that were included in this project:
- ```copy``` and ```cp``` to cpy files.
- ```mkdir``` to create directories/folders.
- ```del``` and ```rm``` to delete folders or files.
- ```dir``` and ```ls``` to list files and directories.
- ```cd``` to move between folders.
- ```move``` and ```mv``` to move files or directories.
- ```rmdir``` to delete empty directories.
- ```more``` and ```cat``` to show the contents of a file.
- ```echo``` to output the string that are being passes as arguments.
